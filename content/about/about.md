Hi, I'm Anna, a student developer and currently a graduate student at the University of British Columbia. I am interested in software architecture design and development of complex software systems. I enjoy writing code for work, fun and research. Most of my coding projects can be found on [Github](https://github.com/scholtzan). More details about my experience can be found on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/ascholtz).

For fun, I often go hiking, do 3D printing or play board games with friends. I frequently travel around and sometimes [write about my adventures](https://travel.scholtzan.net/).
