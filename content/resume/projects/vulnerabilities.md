Development of a tool that statically analyses Python code for known vulnerable functions and dependencies. The tool provides a IDE plugin for Sublime for highlighting vulnerabilities as well as a command-line interface that allows to analyze local projects and GitHub repositories. The tool was used to conduct a study on popular Python libraries revealing that around 8% use unsafe methods.
