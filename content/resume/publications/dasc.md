**Abstract:** Swiftly meeting challenges by distributing tasks to the most suitable knowledge workers is an important matter, especially for network-centric organizations. In such distributed work environments delegations help to solve tasks faster, but also require measures to prevent delegatees from exceeding assigned competencies. By providing universal identification, WebID by W3C can assist in establishing a basis for distributed collaboration. Yet, it does not allow users for delegating access rights to others in a controlled way to act on their behalves. This paper presents the DASC approach to enable scope-aware delegations in distributed social networks using WebID. We introduce a vocabulary to describe delegations including associated constraints and demonstrate a prototypical implementation of DASC within an existing WebID identity provider.
