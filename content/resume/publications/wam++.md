**Abstract:** With increasing complexity of web-based applications, traditional engineering from scratch becomes an effortful matter with security aspects difficult to oversee. By composing applications from reusable building blocks, component-based web engineering approaches promise to reduce time to market while providing flexibility to changing conditions. Yet, they face a trade off between developing software in an agile fashion and establishing a solid security foundation. To mitigate risks through successful attacks, web engineers must however ensure security during the entire lifetime of web-based applications. The WAM++ approach combines well with existing methodology and assists engineers in designing web-based applications with a strong emphasis on security. Based on the theoretical foundation from prior work, WAM++ introduces a vocabulary to describe both the architecture of web-based applications and involved services. Furthermore, WAM++ supports engineers by an online diagraming tool that is prototypically implemented in the Sociddea identity management platform.
